# Memorization-Checker

You will need to download and install the Speech Recognizer and PyAudio packages for this to work (you may also need to install systemtools). The WHL files for Speech Recognizer and PyAudio can be found here:

https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/

https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/

Under "Navigation" on the left click on "Download files" and place them in your Python folder. Once done, open a command prompt with your Python folder as the root and use the command "python -m pip install filename" with filename being the entire filename for the files.

If the program does not register your microphone you will need to install systemtools using the same method for the packages (e.g. python -m pip install systemtools)
